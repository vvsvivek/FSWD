                Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is a dynamic and rapidly growing field that focuses on the
                design, development, and application of computer systems and software. It combines theoretical knowledge
                with practical skills to solve real-world problems using technology. Students in CSE learn programming
                languages, data structures, algorithms, operating systems, databases, computer networks, artificial
                intelligence, and more. The branch opens up a wide range of career opportunities in software
                development, data science, cybersecurity, machine learning, web development, and research. With
                technology playing a central role in almost every industry, CSE continues to be one of the most
                in-demand and future-ready engineering disciplines.
