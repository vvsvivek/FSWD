                            <h3> ABOUT ME</h3>

                            My name is Varanasi Vijaya Sai Vivek, but most people call me Sai.
                            I’m currently pursuing my first year of BTech and actively working on improving my technical
                            and
                            communication skills.
                            I’ve completed a GDSE course in Generative AI and enjoy developing innovative tech
                            solutions, including
                            AI-based applications.
                            One of my key projects is a Pomodoro app that adapts to the user's mood using AI. I also
                            explore
                            real-world problems through design thinking,
                            such as traffic management, aerial seeding, and smart educational games. I like
                            experimenting with C
                            programs, web and app development using
                            JavaScript, React Native, and Python. Outside of tech, I enjoy music—especially songs by SS
                            Thaman—and
                            I’m working hard to improve my English by practicing daily.
                            I'm always curious, creative, and committed to building things that make life easier and
                            smarter.
